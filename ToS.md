Light is committed to providing you with easy browsing without restrictions. It is important to us that you use our services honestly. Our proxy is designed to maintain privacy and enhance your browsing experience, not to facilitate any illegal activity. We reserve the right to suspend or restrict your access to our services if we determine that our policies or rules have been violated.

# Section 2: Safety
We pride ourselves on safety and reliability, but the internet is inherently unpredictable. We cannot be held liable for any incident, damage, or loss that may arise from the use of our proxy service. This includes data loss, security breaches, or other unexpected events.

## Section 2.1: Official Light links/deployments
We host domains on our own servers, which allows official domains to be used by everyone. When official domains are used, please be responsible online.

## Section 2.2: BYOD (bring your own domain) and unofficial deployment links
Light offers a BYOD feature, which allows you to import your own domain. While we provide the platform to do this, we do not monitor the security or performance of these user-generated links. By choosing BYOD, you accept that you are fully responsible for the security, maintenance, and performance of your domain. We are not responsible for any inconvenience, damage, or loss that may occur through the use of unverified embedded links. You agree to release any information relating to the use of these links.
